# Total Sample Pages

Easily copy/paste the code from any Total demo page into your WP text editor then switch over to the Visual Composer to achive the same layout.

## Important

The code is only for the page content, so it obviously does not include the page meta options. By importing the page content it will not alter your page layout (full-screen, no sidebar, left sidebar, right sidebar) or select specific header styles, or disable the page title...etc. So if you have any questions after importing the content on how to get the exact same look, let us know via the ThemeForest comments!
